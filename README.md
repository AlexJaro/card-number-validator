# card-number-validator
Will validate your credit card, tell you its brand and its length. Could have done more but it seems they can ID what bank it was issued from/country of issue/whether it is a debit or credit card etc from the first 6 numbers and then match stuff through a huge csv file is too much for what I know currently and I am not trying to make an alternative to services such as binlist but doing a couple little projects on my own.

It identifies the most well known credit card issuers. Should be fine for most people.
